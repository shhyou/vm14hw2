- Abstract

    Our code can be found at https://github.com/suhorng/vm14hw2

    > We study the same ISA system virtual machine on a simulated ARM Cortex A15x1
    platform. We build one host VM which runs one or more guest VMs, trace the hypervisor
    traps in the **kvm** module. We also run serveral benchmarks on multiple guest VMs
    to observe the loadings.

## Part I - Trap Profiling

### Virtual Machine Setup Difficulties

### The KVM Architecture Overview

### Implementation

### Trace Result

## Part II - Experimenting Multiple Guests
